<div>
	<h1>An HTML file</h1>

	<p>This is a regular HTML file in src/main/resources/html.</p>

	<p>You can do whatever you want in your HTML as long as you
		remember three small gotchas:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Script tags are ignored because of the browser's security
			features.
		<li>Internal links should include the "html" section in the path
			and use the routerLink attribute, like this: <a
			href="html/example.html" routerLink>Example link</a>.
		<li>The HTML file must have one top-level element
	</ul>
